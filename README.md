# impractical-python-projects-ikea-names
A random name generator inspired by the Silly Name Generator project in Impractical Python Projects, a book written by Lee Vaughan. I've taken product names from the IKEA website to create a random name generator aimed at creating names for NPCs in role playing games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons!
